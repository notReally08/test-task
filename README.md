Hello! I am very sorry for the delay. Unfortunately, I managed to do only autocomplete feature.
What was planned: to use a combination of react query and ui autocomplete using the debounced approach (search as you type). For validation and input logic (which is described in the task) I wanted to apply Zustand and Yup.
I have a habit of understanding everything thoroughly before putting it into practice. This helps to perform tasks better, but can significantly slow down the development process.
 
Anyway, thanks a lot for the opportunity!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
